# Bash script that will search for a specific word or string of text in a folder containing 100 files
In this script, replace /path/to/folder with the actual path to the folder containing the files you want to search through, and replace your_search_term_here with the word or string of text you want to search for.

The script will loop through each file in the folder and use the grep command to search for the search term in each file. If the search term is found, the script will print the filename and the line number where the search term was found.

To run the script, save the above code in a file with a .sh extension (e.g., search.sh), make it executable using chmod +x search.sh, and then run it using ./search.sh.
